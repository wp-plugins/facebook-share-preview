== Description ==

The Facebook Share Preview Plugin adds the required meta-data to an audio post so Facebook can embed your audio directly onto their site.

Please rate this plugin if you download it, or leave a message in the forums if you have any questions. I want to make this plugin better and easier to use, but I need your feedback.

Thanks,
Sandro

== Installation ==

1. Upload folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Update Settings in WordPress under Setting -> Facebook Share Preview

== Screenshots ==

1. A blog post with an audio enclosure using the microAudio plugin.
2. Me sharing a link to my audio blog post.
3. Shows what Facebook retrieves from the meta-data that is inserted by this plugin.
4. The Facebook audio player embeds your music directly into the newsfeed.
5. Facebook Share Preview settings in WordPress.

== Things to Note ==

- This plugin assumes that an enclosure is being used to describe the audio.
- Plugins such as, microAudio, podPress, and other podcasting plugins should do this.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the default information for a single post? =

Yes. Use the following custom fields on the blog post to change the settings:

* `audio_title`
* `audio_artist`
* `audio_album` - Album name of the audio track.
* `image_src` - The album art that will be displayed on the Facebook newsfeed.
